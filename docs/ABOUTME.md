## Why This Project

I chose Problem Statement A (Tasks Generator) because it combines my interests in AI integration and building useful developer tools. The retro NES.css theme was a deliberate choice to make the submission memorable while still delivering a fully functional planning tool.

Key decisions I made:
- **OpenRouter** over a single LLM provider — gives model flexibility and free-tier access
- **Template fallback** — the app works even without API keys or internet
- **SQLite database** — proper persistence instead of just localStorage
- **Docker support** — one-command deployment as an alternative to hosting
